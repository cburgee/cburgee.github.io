        I am an enthusiastic Junior Software Developer eager to advance the
        skills and knowledge I have obtained through my educational pursuits. I
        possess a logical mindset, providing me a key advantage in the world of
        software development and automation. I have used computers and
        electronic devices for the majority of my life which sparked my interest
        in understanding how they work on a deeper level. This, and the fact
        that my father is a software developer, is what influenced me to direct
        my efforts toward learning software development and DevOps. In 2020
        after Covid-19 hit headlines, my hours were cut severely and this was
        just the catalyst I needed to start my journey towards becoming a
        software developer and automation engineer.
