This is a simple react application showcasing my past projects (or will soon :D).

This was built using React, JavaScript, CSS, and HTML.

When I was first reading the assignment for class, I thought we had to create two separte projects: one for API use and one for our portfolio. I originally was going to build a full blown weather-data application, however just dummed it down to the current temp after realizing the projects were two in the same.

When it comes to site organization, I far prefer using multiple, simple clean web-pages in comprison to a complex single page.

At the time of writing this README, 08/20/2023, I am having major issues with coming up with designs for my website. I figured out how I wanted the "skeleton" to be structured, however I can't decide what colors, fonts, etc.
